# Steganography
## Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography (Python)
This project presents an efficient approach to image steganography using Python and OpenCV. It enables users to securely embed (encrypt) a secret message within an image and later extract (decrypt) it through an intuitive Tkinter-based GUI.

### Key Features
_Data Hiding (Encryption)_

1) Securely embed a text message into an image by encoding each character’s ASCII value within image pixels using a diagonal embedding technique.
2) The modified image is saved as a lossless PNG file, ensuring data integrity and preventing quality degradation.

_Message Extraction (Decryption)_

1) Retrieve the hidden message from the encrypted image by entering the correct passcode and message length.

_Graphical User Interface (GUI)_

1) Upload a cover image for embedding.
2) Enter a secret message and set a passcode.
3) Encrypt the message securely within the image.
4) Upload an encrypted image for message extraction.
5) Decrypt and instantly retrieve the hidden message.

This project provides a simple, secure, and efficient method for confidential communication using steganography.

**ADVANTAGES OF STEGANOGRAPHY**

_Enhanced Security –_ 
Conceals confidential information in images, which cannot be located.

_Maintains Image Quality –_ 
Utilizes lossless PNG image format to prevent any recognizable distortion.

_User-Friendly Interface –_ 
Possesses a user-friendly GUI for easy encryption and decryption.

_Password Protection –_ 
Requires a passcode to pull out the message, giving it an additional layer of protection.

_Supports Multiple Use Cases –_ 
Supports secure communication, digital forensics, and storage of confidential data.

_Hard to Identify –_ 
Steganography is not under suspicion like classic encryption.

_Lightweight and Fast –_ 
It adds and removes messages in real-time without much computation.
